# Panagora Code Test

## What's here?

- `design/` styleguide and site design
- `images/` a couple of product images
- `static/` static assets that you will need
- `<PRODUCT_ID>.json`
- `products.json`
- `webpack.config.js` webpack config with dev server
- `index.html` a bare minumum html template
- `index.js` empty index.js
- `index.scss` empty index.scss

## Instructions

The idea here is to build a single page application with JavaScript. We have provided a set of files and assets that we want you to use to achieve this (see above).

First run `npm install`. We have provided you with a set of npm packages and a `webpack.config.js` to get started. Take a peak at `package.json` to see available commands.

You will find the styleguide and site design in `design/`. We want this implemented.

In `data/` you will find a couple of json files that will act as your "backend". `products.json` holds a list of simplified product representations and `<PRODUCT_ID>.json` is an actual product representation.

On one page we want all products rendered. When clicking on one of the products we want to see a product page with full product info and a form to add the product to a cart. Layout this page however you want but use the design elements from the styleguide.

Feel free to use any template language of your choice i.e Nunjucks, EJS, Mustache or perhaps Pug. Template literals is also fine.

**Important:** Please tell us how much time you spent on this and describe your work to us! Just a couple of sentences of each step you took or if something was unclear and how you solved it.

## Tips

We will only test your site in the newest Chrome/Firefox browser so feel free to use `html5`, `css3`, `es6`, `canvas` or anything else you need. If you need to use a nightly build don't forget to tell us!




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
